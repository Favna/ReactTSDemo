# ReactTS Demo App

This app is a demo for the **React In a TypeScript World** workshop given internally to the AIR development team at CGI Inc. The Netherlands. The goal of the repository is to have sample code to show during the presentation to give practical examples alongside the theoretical information.

TODO:

 - ContainerComponent Test
 - Maybe test config.ts and index.ts in redux folder?
 - MaterialUI Demo
